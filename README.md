# BasicCRUD


This is a simple program that provides endpoints to add/remove/update data.

Backend - TypeScript, NodeJs, Express and postgreSQL.

I am still learning Typescript and node and this code was written by scratch


## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install foobar.

To start server:

npm run start
```
To start server via [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (automatically updates changes in code):
```bash

```
To build the project and convert the TypeScript files into normal JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```
